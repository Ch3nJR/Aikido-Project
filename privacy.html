            following entities or organisation outside aikiForest in order to
            fulfil our services to you:

          <h3>6. Who We Disclose Your Personal Data to</h3>
          <h4>6.1 Obtaining Consent</h4>
          <p>
            We will notify you of the purpose before we collect, use or disclose
            your personal data. We will obtain confirmation from you on your
            expressed consent. We will seek fresh consent from you if the
            original purpose for the collection, use or disclosure of your
            personal data has changed. However, when you voluntarily provide
            your personal data for a purpose and it is reasonable that you do so
            we may rely on you being deemed to have consented to us collecting,
            using and disclosing your personal data for that purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under certain circumstances, we may collect, use and/or disclose
            personal data about you without your consent for example, so that we
            can comply with our statutory obligations or where personal data is
            publicly available.
          </p>

          <h4>6.2 Withdrawal of Consent</h4>
          <p>
            If you have given us consent to collect, use, disclose and otherwise
            process personal data about you, you may withdraw that consent at
            any time. You should give us reasonable advance notice of your
            withdrawal of consent. We will notify you of the likely consequences
            of your withdrawal of consent, e.g. without your personal contact
            information we may not be able to inform you of future updates or
            that the quality of our service may be impacted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your request for withdrawal of consent can take the form of an email
            or letter to us, or through the UNSUB feature in an online service.
          </p>

          <h4>6.3 Third-Party Consent</h4>
          <p>
            We do not get consent of behalf of another individual. We only get
            consent from the individual who will be dealing directly with us.

          <h3>7. How We Ensure the Accuracy of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data we
            collect about you is accurate, complete, not misleading and kept up
            to date.
          </p>

          <p>
            From time to time, we may do a verification exercise for you to
            update us on any changes to the personal data we hold about you. If
            we are in an ongoing relationship with you, it is important that you
            update us if there are any changes in the personal data we hold
            about you (such as a change in your contact number).

        <div class="content">
          <h3>8. How We Protect Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            We have implemented an Information Security Policy that governs how
            we protect personal data. We make reasonable security arrangements
            to protect personal data about you that is in our possession or
            under our control to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,
            disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. All
            our employees will take reasonable and appropriate measures to
            maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data,
            and will only share your data with authorised persons on a 'need to
            know' basis
          </p>

          <p>
            When we engage third-party entities to process personal data on our
            behalf, we will ensure that they provide sufficient guarantees to us
            in respect of the technical and organisational security measures,
            and have taken reasonable steps to ensure compliance with these
            measures.

        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h3>9. How We Retain Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            We will not retain any documents containing personal data about you
            as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which we
            collected that personal data is no longer being served by retention
            of it and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business
            purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have a Document Retention Policy that spells out when we must
            cease to retain personal data and that requires documents and
            personal data to be destroyed (paper documents) or deleted
            (electronic documents and data stored in databases) securely.
            Certain retention periods are based on statutory or regulatory
            requirements.

            request as soon as possible, or within 30 days from the date we
            receive your request. If we are unable to do so within the 30 days,

            country or territory outside Singapore, we will ensure that the
            recipient organisation will provide the standard of data protection
